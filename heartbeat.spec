%description
heartbeat is a basic high-availability subsystem for Linux-HA.
It will run scripts at initialization, and when machines go up or down.
This version will also perform IP address takeover using gratuitous ARPs.

Heartbeat contains a cluster membership layer, fencing, and local and
clusterwide resource management functionality.

When used with Pacemaker, it supports "n-node" clusters with significant 
capabilities for managing resources and dependencies.

In addition it continues to support the older release 1 style of
2-node clustering.

It implements the following kinds of heartbeats:
        - Serial ports
        - UDP/IP multicast (ethernet, etc)
        - UDP/IP broadcast (ethernet, etc)
        - UDP/IP heartbeats
        - "ping" heartbeats (for routers, switches, etc.)
           (to be used for breaking ties in 2-node systems)

+ Version 2.0.3 - Bug fixes and significant new features.
  + Management Daemon/Library and GUI client
    + provide a management library for manamgement daemon and CIM provider
    + provide a management daemon and a basic GUI management tool
  + CIM enablement
    + CIM (Common Information Model) enablement - works with
      sblim-sfcb, OpenWBEM, and Pegasus CIMOMs
    - not yet compiled into our binary RPMs because of dependencies
  + CRM (Cluster Resource Manager) General
    + All shutdowns go via the PE/TE - preserves inter-resource ordering
    + Support for future changes to the CIB (depreciation of cib_fragment)
    + Overhaul of IPC and HA channel callback logic
    + Many improvments to the quality and quantity (reduced) of logging
  + CRMd
    + Timerless elections - when everyone has voted we're done
    + Use the replace notification from the CIB to re-update our copy with 
      our view of our peers.
    + Reliably detect if the LRM connection is still active.
    + Elections
      + newer versions defer to older ones in DC elections 
        (opposite of current behavior)
      + this means that only once the complete cluster has been upgraded will
        we start acting like the new version and accept new config options
      + it also means newer PE's and TE's (the most complex pieces) don't need
        "act like the old version" options and can rely on all slaves being at
        least as up-to-date as they are
      + people can run mixed clusters as long as they want
        (until they want the new PE features)
      + new DCs only update the version number in the CIB if they have a 
        higher value
      + nodes that start and have a lower version than that stored in the CIB
        shut themselves down (the CRM part anyway)
      + this prevents an admin from introducing old nodes back into an upgraded
        cluster. It probably doesn't fully understand the config and may not
        support the actions the PE/TE requires.
  + CIB (Common Information Base daemon)
    + Make sure "query only" connections cant modify the CIB
    + Periodically dump some stats about what the CIB has been doing.
    + Verify there are no memory leaks
    + Performance enhancements
    + Prevent a single CIB client from blocking everyone else
    + Clients Can be notified of full CIB replacements
    + record_config_changes option in ha.cf for those worried about 
      the amount of logging.  Defaults to "on".
    + suppress_cib_writes CIB option replaced with in enable_config_writes ha.cf 
      (enable_config_writes to be removed in 2.0.4)
    + Never write the status section to disk
    + Check permissions for the on-disk CIB at startup
    + Dont trash unreadable on-disk CIBs
    + Fix for updates made against the whole CIB (not just one section) 
  + PEngine (Policy Engine)
    + Many improvements to the handling of resource groups
    + Support "anonymous" clones
    + Fix stonith ordering
    + Order DC shutdowns after everyone else's
    + Support short resource names (for group and clone resources)
    + The ordering and colocation of grouped resources is now optional
    + Support probing new nodes for active resources.
    + All "probe" actions are controlled by the PE.
      + No resource may be started until the probing is complete.
      + Do not probe for resources we know to be active on unprobed nodes
    + When looking for monitor ops, only mark it optional if it was already
      active on the node we're interested in.
    + Detect changes to class/type/provider/parameters and force a restart
      of the resource
    + New record_pengine_inputs option in ha.cf for those worried about 
      the amount of logging.  Defaults to "on".
    + Differentiate between config and processing errors
      + reduces the frequency that we need to log the complete CIB
    + Make notify for master/slave work
    + New CIB option: stop_orphan_actions (boolean)
      If a resource is no longer defined, we can optionally stop it
    + New CIB option: stop_orphan_actions (boolean)
      If a monitor op for a given interval is no longer defined, we can
      optionally stop it
    + Add support for time and phase-of-the-moon based constraints
    + Improved failure handling: avoiding false positives
    + Always create orphaned resources - so they show up in crm_mon
    + Do not require sequential clone numbers starting at 0
  + TEngine (transition engine)
    + Detect old stonith ops
  + CLIs (Command Line interfaces)
    + Create a --one-shot option for crm_mon
    + Switch a number of CLI tools to use the new syncronous connections
    + Log errors to stderr where they will be seen and therefore useful
    + Support migration and un-migration of resources and resource groups
    + Create crm_verify for checking configuration validity
    + Simplify the passing of XML to cibadmin
  + Known open bugs worth mentioning:
    + 1075, 1080, 1081, 1084, 1085, 1064, 1069, 756, 984
    + 1050, 1082, 1037, 1079
    
* Thu Sep 22 2005  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.2 - small bug fix only release
  + Fixed a bug in ping directive - it works again
  + Added a check to BasicSanityCheck to check ping and ping_group directives
  + fixed cl_status nodestatus to return 0 if a node has status "ping"
  + fixed a memory leak in the CRM's LRM interface code
  + fixed code which deterimines which version of the CRM becomes
    the DC when basic CIB schema versions differ.  It now prefers
    the older version to be DC instead of the newer version.

* Wed Sep 14 2005  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.1 - 
  + Communication Layer

    + Rules can now contain other rules
    + Date/Time based expressions are supported
    + Cloned resources can now optionally be notified before and after
      any of its peers are stopped or started.
    + The cluster can re-evaluate the configuration automatically after
      a defined interval of idleness
  + Removed a flow control message which was very annoying when operating
    in a mixed 1.x/2.x environment
  -- Known Bugs :-( --
    - Bug 859 - FSA took too long to complete action - fully recovered from
    - Bug 882 - IPC channel not connected during shutdown - harmless
    - Bug 879 - Failed actions cause extra election - harmless
 Each of these occurs about once or twice in 5000 test iterations
       - This is probably > 10K failovers
    - rsc_location constraints cannot have rules that contain other rules
      (fixed in CVS after release)

+ Version 2.0.0 - First stable release of the next generation of the Linux-HA project
  + Basic Characteristics described here:
        http://linux-ha.org/FactSheetv2
  + Core infrastructure improvments:
    + Messaging (message acknowledging and flow control)
    + Logging   (logging daemon)
  + Release 1.x style (2-node) clusters fully supported
  + Multi-node support (so far up to 16-node clusters tested)
        See http://linux-ha.org/GettingStartedV2 for more information
  + New components:
    + Cluster Information Base    (replicated resource configuration)
    + Cluster Resource Manager    (supporting 1->N nodes)
    + Modular Policy Engine       (controlling resource placement)
    + Local Resource Manager      (policy free, not cluster aware)
    + Stonith Daemon              (stand-alone fencing  subsytem)
  + Support for OCF and LSB resource agents
  + Support for composite resource types (groups, clones)
  + Support for a rich set of resource location and ordering constraints
  + Conversion tool for existing haresources
  + Resources monitored by request
  + Resource "maintenance" mode
  + Several failback, failure and "No Quorum" behaviours to choose from
        (global defaults and per action or resource)
  + Sample cluster state and configuration monitoring tools

  Known issues in 2.0.0:
    - Under some rare circumstances the cluster manager will time out
      while stabilizing a new cluster state.  This appears to be
        otherwise harmless - the cluster is actually fine.
        http://www.osdl.org/developer_bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=770
    - Under some rare circumstances, a dev assert will be triggered
        in unpack.c.  This results in the pengine getting restarted.
        This is annoying, but not a disaster.

* Mon Oct 11 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.99.0 - *early* beta series - preparing for 2.0.0
  + All STABLE changes noted below have been ported to this branch
  + Included in this release is a beta of the next generation of Heartbeat
        resource manager developed by Andrew Beekhof.  
        http://linuxha.trick.ca/NewHeartbeatDesign is a good place to learn
        more about this effort. Please examine crm/README, crm/test/README
        and crm/crm-1.0.dtd for example usage and configuration.
  + Also included is the L(ocal) R(esource) M(anager) developed by IBM China
        which is an integral part of the NewHeartbeatDesign.
  + Known caveats:
    - STONITH as a whole has seen a code cleanup and should be tested
      carefully.
    - The external STONITH plug-in has undergone major surgery and
      probably doesn't work yet.
    - the new CRM is not perfectly stable with 3 nodes yet.
  + PLEASE see http://osdl.org/developer_bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Linux-HA
    and use it to report quirks and issues you find!

* Tue Feb 16 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.2.0
  + Replaced the nice_failback option with the auto_failback option.
        THIS OBSOLETES THE NICE_FAILBACK OPTION. READ THE DOCS FOR HOW
        TO UPGRADE SMOOTHLY.
  + Added a new feature to hb_standby which allows you to give up
          any specific category of resources:  local, foreign, or all.
        The old behavior is "all" which is the default.
        This allows you to put a auto_failback no cluster into
          an active/active configuration on demand.
  + ipfail now works properly with auto_failback on (active/active)
  + ipfail now has "hysteresis" so that it doesn't respond immediately
        to a network failure, but waits a little while so that the
        damage can be properly assessed and extraneous takeovers avoided
  + Added new ping node timeout directive "deadping"
  + Made sure heartbeat preallocated stack and heap, and printed a
        message if we allocate heap once we're started up...
  + IPMILan STONITH plugin added to CVS
  + Added IPaddr2 resource script
  + Made the APC smart UPS ups code compatible with more UPSes
  + Added a (preliminary?) ordered messaging facility from Yi Zhu
  + Changed IPaddr's method of doing ARPs in background so that
        certain timing windows were closed.
  + Added OCF (wrapper) resource script
  + Allow respawn programs to take arguments
  + Added pinggroups (where any node being up is OK)
  + SIGNIFICANT amount of internal rearchitecture.
  + Many bug fixes.
  + Several documentation updates.

* Tue Feb 10 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.1.5
  + ipfail now has "hysteresis" so that it doesn't respond immediately
        to a network failure, but waits a little while so that the
        damage can be properly assessed and extraneous takeovers avoided
  + Several fixes to cl_poll()
  + More fixes to the IPC code - especially handling data reception
        after EOF
  + removed some unclean code from GSource for treating EOF conditions
  + Several bugs concerning hanging when shutting down early during startup
  + A few BasicSanityCheck bug fixes
  + CTS now allows a single machine to be able to monitor several clusters

* Fri Jan 22 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.1.4

  + Changed the API to use sockets (IPC library) instead of FIFOs.
  + Added new apiauth directives to provide authorization information
        formerly provided by the FIFO permissions.
  + Added Intel's implementation of the SAF data checkpointing API and daemon
  + Added a cleanup suggested by Emily Ratliff.
  + IPMILan STONITH plugin added to CVS

  + Various cleanups due to horms.
  + Fixed authentication to work on 64-bit platforms(!)
  + Fixed the cl_poll() code to handle corner cases better
  + Made heartbeat close watchdog device before re-execing itself
  + New CTS improvements from Mi, Jun <jun.mi@intel.com>
  + Various minor bug fixes.
      . Several shutdown bugs addressed
      . fixed sendarp to make a pid file, so we can shut it down
          when we shut everything else down in case it's still running.
      . Lots of minor bug fixes to IPC code
      . Lots of minor bug fixes to ipctest program
      . made BasicSanityCheck more tolerant of delays
      . Fixed IPC code to authenticate based on ints, not int*s.
      . Check properly for strnlen instead of strlen...
      . Several signed/unsigned fixes
      . A few uninitialized vars now are inited
      . Switched to compiling lex/yacc sources the automake way
      . Lots of minor CTS fixes...

  + ldirectord bug fixes:
    . When new real servers are added on initialisation or when
        the configuration file is reread they are marked with status
        of -1 (uninitialised) so they will be checked and inserted
        into the virtual service as required
    . All checks use the checkport if set, otherwise the port set for
        the individual real server. This was the case for http and
        connect checks, but others had variations on this theme.
    . When the configuration file is reread because it changed
        on disk and autoreload is set, check the real servers
        immediately rather than waiting for checkinterval to expire
    . Already running message sent to stderr instead of stdout
    . Support alternate server in real-server specific URL
    . Treat the same real server with different weights as a different
        real server. Fixes bug reported by Philip Hayward whereby the same
        real-server would always have the same weight, regardless of
        the ldirectord.cf

* Fri Sep 26 2003  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.1.3
  + Bugfix for heartbeat starting resources twice concurrently if
    auto_failback was set to "legacy".

    names properly when current node not found in the ha.cf file
  + Send a message to the cluster whenever we have a node which doesn't
    need STONITHing - even though it's gone down.  This fix needed

  + Added several new "plumbing" subsystems (IPC, longclock_t, proctrack, etc.)
  + Added a new "contrib" directory.
  + Fixed serious (but trivial) bug in the process tracking code which caused
        it to exit heartbeat - this occured repeatably for STONITH operations.
  + Write a 'v' to the watchdog device to tell it not to reboot us when
        we close the device.
  + Various ldirectord fixes due to Horms
  + Minor patch from Lorn Kay to deal with loopback interfaces which might

  + Made media modules and authentication modules and stonith modules
        dynamically loadable.

  + Added Multicast media support
  + Added ping node/membership/link type for tiebreaking.  This will
        be useful when implementing quorum on 2-node systems.

  + Fixed various logging bugs
  + Closed holes in protection against replay attacks

  + Added checks that complain if all resources aren't idle on startup.
  + IP address takeover fixes
      + Endian fixes
      + Removed the 8-alias limitation
      + Takeovers now occur faster (ARPs occur asynchronously)

  + Port number changes
    + Use our IANA port number (694) by default
    + Recognize our IANA port number ("ha-cluster") if it's in /etc/services

  + Moved several files, etc. from /var/run to /var/lib/heartbeat

* Fri Jun 30 2000 Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>
+ Version 0.4.8
  + Incorporated ldirectord version 1.9 (fixes memory leak)
  + Made the order of resource takeover more rational:  Takeover is now
    left-to-right, and giveup is right-to-left
  + Changed the default port number to our official IANA port number (694)
  + Regularized more messages, eliminated some redundant ones.
  + Print the version of heartbeat when starting.
  + Print exhaustive version info when starting with debug on.
  + Hosts now have 3 statuses {down, up, active} active means that it knows
        that all its links are operational, and it's safe to send cluster
        messages
  + Significant revisions to nice_failback (mainly due to lclaudio)
  + More SuSE-compatibility. Thanks to Friedrich Lobenstock <fl@fl.priv.at>
  + Tidied up logging so it can be to files, to syslog or both (Horms)
  + Tidied up build process (Horms)
  + Updated ldirectord to produce and install a man page and be
    compatible with the fwmark options to The Linux Virtual Server (Horms)
  + Added log rotation for ldirectord and heartbeat using logrotate
    if it is installed
  + Added Audible Alarm resource by Kirk Lawson <lklawson@heapy.com> 
    and myself (Horms)
  + Added init script for ldirectord so it can be run independently
    of heartbeat (Horms)
  + Added sample config file for ldirectord (Horms)
  + An empty /etc/ha.d/conf/ is now part of the rpm distribution
    as this is where ldirectord's configuration belongs (Horms)
  + Minor startup script tweaks.  Hopefully, we should be able to make core
    files should we crash in the future.  Thanks to Holger Kiehl for diagnosing
    the problem!
  + Fixed a bug which kept the "logfile" option from ever working.
  + Added a TestCluster test utility.  Pretty primitive so far...
  + Fixed the serial locking code so that it unlocks when it shuts down.
  + Lock heartbeat into memory, and raise our priority
  + Minor, but important fix from lclaudio to init uninited variable.

* Sat Dec 25 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>
+ Version 0.4.7
  + Added the nice_failback feature. If the cluster is running when
        the primary starts it acts as a secondary. (Luis Claudio Goncalves)
  + Put in lots of code to make lost packet retransmission happen
  + Stopped trying to use the /proc/ha interface
  + Finished the error recovery in the heartbeat protocol (and got it to work)
  + Added test code for the heartbeat protocol
  + Raised the maximum length of a node name
  + Added Jacob Rief's ldirectord resource type
  + Added Stefan Salzer's <salt@cin.de> fix for a 'grep' in IPaddr which
        wasn't specific enough and would sometimes get IPaddr confused on
        IP addresses that prefix-matched.
  + Added Lars Marowsky-Bree's suggestion to make the code almost completely
        robust with respect to jumping the clock backwards and forwards
  + Added code from Michael Moerz <mike@cubit.at> to keep findif from
        core dumping if /proc/route can't be read.

  + Fixed timing problem in "heartbeat restart" so it's reliable now
  + Made start/stop status compatible with SuSE expectations
  + Made resource status detection compatible with SuSE start/stop expectations
  + Fixed a bug relating to serial and ppp-udp authentication (it never worked)
  + added a little more substance to the error recovery for the HB protocol.
  + Fixed a bug for logging from shell scripts
  + Added a little logging for initial resource acquisition
  + Added #!/bin/sh to the front of shell scripts
  + Fixed Makefile, so that the build root wasn't compiled into pathnames

+ Version 0.4.5
  + Mijta Sarp added a new feature to authenticate heartbeat packets
        using a variety of strong authentication techniques
  + Changed resource acquisition and relinquishment to occur in heartbeat,
       instead of in the start/stop script.  This means you don't *really*
       have to use the start/stop script if you don't want to.
  + Added -k option to gracefully shut down current heartbeat instance
  + Added -r option to cause currently running heartbeat to reread config files
  + Added -s option to report on operational status of "heartbeat"
  + Sped up resource acquisition on master restart.
  + Added validation of ipresources file at startup time.
  + Added code to allow the IPaddr takeover script to be given the
        interface to take over, instead of inferring it.  This was requested
        by Lars Marowsky-Bree
  + Incorporated patch from Guenther Thomsen to implement locking for
        serial ports used for heartbeats
  + Incorporated patch from Guenther Thomsen to clean up logging.
        (you can now use syslog and/or file logs)
  + Improved FreeBSD compatibility.
  + Fixed a bug where the FIFO doesn't get created correctly.
  + Fixed a couple of uninitialized variables in heartbeat and /proc/ha code
  + Fixed longstanding crash bug related to getting a SIGALRM while in malloc
        or free.
  + Implemented new memory management scheme, including memory stats

* Thu Sep 16 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>

        PPP configurations
  + Put in a fix from Gregor Howey <ghowey@bremer-nachrichten.de>
        where Gregor found that I had stripped off the ::resourceid part
        of the string in ResourceManager resulting in some bad calls later on.
  +  Made it compliant with the FHS (filesystem hierarchy standard)
  +  Fixed IP address takeover so we can take over on non-eth0 interface
  +  Fixed IP takeover code so we can specify netmasks and broadcast addrs,
        or default them at the user's option.

+ Version 0.4.2
  + Implemented simple resource groups
  + Implemented application notification for groups starting/stopping
  + Eliminated restriction on floating IPs only being associated with eth0
  + Added a uniform resource model, with IP resources being only one kind.
        (Thanks to Lars Marowsky-Bree for a good suggestion)
  + Largely rewrote the IP address takeover code, making it clearer, fit
        into the uniform resource model, and removing some restrictions.
  + Preliminary "Getting Started" document by Rudy Pawul
  + Improved the /proc/ha code
  + Fixed memory leak associated with serial ports, and problem with return
        of control to the "master" node.
        (Thanks to Holger Kiehl for reporting them, and testing fixes!)

+ Version 0.4.1
  + Fixed major memory leak in 0.4.0 (oops!)
  + Added code to eliminate duplicate packets and log lost ones
  + Tightened up PPP/UDP startup/shutdown code
  + Made PPP/UDP peacefully coexist with "normal" udp
  + Made logs more uniform and neater
  + Fixed several other minor bugs
  + Added very preliminary kernel code for monitoring and controlling
        heartbeat via /proc/ha.  Very cool, but not really done yet.

* Wed Jun 30 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>

* Wed Jun 09 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>
+ Version 0.3.2
  + Added UDP/PPP bidirectional serial ring heartbeat
        (PPP ensures data integrity on the serial links)
  + fixed a stupid bug which caused shutdown to give unpredictable
        results
  + added timestamps to /var/log/ha-log messages
  + fixed a couple of other minor oversights.

* Sun May 10 1999  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh>
